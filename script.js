let text = ["On the Way to a Piano Class: This special memory lasted about 13 years, which is the total duration of me learning the piano. However, I would like to specifically focus on the last period of my learning experience. I had learned this instrument in various locations, from musical instrument stores to my teacher’s home. Nevertheless, the last two years were spent in Shanghai Conservatory of Music since my teacher was a professor of music at Shanghai Conservatory of Music at that time. It was a place where various captivating melodies floated in the air. Students learning different musical instruments would wander around on campus, chatting and laughing, discussing about their new musical assignments. Outside the campus, there were cars buzzing, and I could recall the irregular footsteps of pedestrians. Besides, as that area is an artistic location near the most prosperous part of Shanghai, melodies of both musical instruments and human voices were always constantly wafting through the air. This kind of luscious atmosphere of music really impressed me and served as the spice of my life.",
"I got inspired by visiting the tomb of my grandfather, which are the wind sound and the peaceful spaces. So I want to create a memory of my grandfather about his illness and my only memory about him during my childhood.",
"",
"The memory I had chosen was that of me drowning when I was younger. For the feelings I tried to go for in my memory, I wanted the suspense, realization, and safety, but all of which is done by one person, the one person drowning.",
"I chose to recreate the experience of a hectic day while I was at school, aiming to convey the mixed emotions of frustration and fatigue that I felt during that time. The soundscape was crafted to illustrate the various moments of the day, from waking up to navigating through tasks at the school and  digital arts studio. I utilized around 18 different sounds to capture different aspects of my experience and emotions such as tap water, lighting the stove, brushing the teeth, scratching paper in the arts studio and drawing but failing to get desired results Each sound was carefully selected to represent specific moments or feelings, sometimes symbolically rather than literally. ",
"I wanted to create a scene where a person is on the run in a scenario similar to the end of the world. So there should be sound of wind, rain, explosions and collapses in the scene. There will also be the sound of the protagonist’s footsteps and gasping. But the protagonist is actually a character in the game whose movements are controlled by the players.  So the keyboard sounds will play in the background throughout the audio. Finally, after a series of actions, the protagonist finally finds a door, that is, the door of the two-dimensional world and the three-dimensional world. With the sound of opening the door, he will find that behind the door is a game hall, and he is just a character in the game. With some ethereal sounds, the audio ends in a situation that gives the imagination space.",
"The memory I chose to create a soundscape for was my first visit to a cafe. As an avid book reader at the time, I would often study in public places and this particular outing stuck with me. While not attached to strong emotions, the sounds from that day left an impression. I wanted listeners to experience the atmospheric noises without dialogue, conveying what I heard around me through ambient audio. Careful attention was paid to dynamics and context to ensure an accurate portrayal.",
"This memory is special to me in many aspects: my first experience of getting up so early, my first time seeing sunrise with my own eyes, and also the experience of wandering in the local places with the breakfast vibe. Inside the memory itself are various diverse sounds that are quite particular, including the sleepy yawn of myself, the sound of riding a bike, the sound of seagulls and ships in the river that early, together contributing a memory worth treasuring. I then decide to record these relevant sounds near my place and put those sounds together in a time sequence.",
"In my childhood, I was always afraid of piano class. Because I didn’t practice the piece before class, I clearly knew that I would be scolded. Nervous emotions arose outside the teacher’s home. I tried my best to make a mess to avoid going to class. When all the “efforts” were in vain and my requirement was rejected by my father, I cried to take the car to class. On the way, my heart was pounding, my palms were sweating, and my whole body was shaking. The feeling lasted until I arrived. When my mom and my teacher start talking, I usually get so scared that I start to wander off, and then I ask my mom for nail scissors to cut my nails and buy time. Then I finally dragged my chair, sat down on the piano stool, turned on the metronome, opened the music, and I knew my end was coming. I knew at that moment that all my stalling strategies had gone to waste because, as soon as I started playing the first notes, the teacher knew that I hadn’t practiced the previous piece at all. All thoughts returned to the present moment. Shaking hands on the piano, I began to play.",
"I mimic the sounds you would hear on one of the streets in my hometown Karachi, Pakistan. The street would be really calm and quiet and sometime of the day and noisy at the other. So I started my audio with very peaceful sounds to depict the quiet time of the street and then slowly changed it into a very noisy street. ",
"I embarked on a journey back to my childhood kitchen, reminiscing about my first time cooking independently. The memory I aimed to convey encapsulated the nervousness and anxiety I felt, juxtaposed with the familiar sounds of the kitchen appliances and the ticking of the cooking timer. I wanted to evoke a sense of vulnerability and anticipation, capturing the essence of a significant milestone in my culinary journey. ",
"The memory that I picked is the certain day that we were lifted from lockdown for the pandemic. On that day, I was taking online courses and doing my final review for my college entrance exams as usual in a fretful mood, but countless notifications from the phone of the neighborhood group chat let me know the excellent news. I took off my masks and threw them in the trash bin, opened the door, and ran out to breathe the fresh outdoor air we hadn’t encountered in a long time. I walked through the neighborhood with no destination in mind, perhaps just wanting to take a walk in this world of regained freedom. I heard children laughing and playing basketball, grannies gossiping in Shanghainese, bikes and cars driving out, and my feet stepping over fallen leaves on the side of the road, just letting go of my mind and enjoying the moment. Suddenly someone let out a cough and all the beautiful sounds came to a screeching halt again. Everyone seemed to hold their breath, looked to the same place, walked or ran back to their homes, and shut their doors again.",
"I named my memory soundscape project Last Moment as I chose the feelings of my last few minutes in my Gaokao examination as the main memory for this project. To show the memory of these minutes, I chose both actucal sounds we could here in the classroom and also the feelings. My initial idea was to only convey the feelings, which I found quite difficult to convey this idea of taking your very last exam in your high school life. So I decided to begin with the actual sounds to introduce the environment, then transit to the sounds that could imitate my feelings and end with actual sounds to bring listeners back to reality.",
"The memory for my Memory Soundscape project was my memory of taking a trip to the sea, seeing the boderless beautiful sea and got really relaxed. I’m a sea person that would always choose seaside to be my destinations of my trips, and I can slways get refreshed and fully relaxed when coming to the seaside. ",
"In this memory soundscape, I want to call back a risky memory of me riding bicycle but nearly crashed into a truck because I got carried away. This soundscape is divided into two parts-before the truck and after the truck. Before the truck went by, I want to emphasize my relaxed feeling and restore the original sound effects, so I panned different sounds to different sides to show this difference. And after the truck went by, I want to first convey the anxious and nervous feeling, and afterwards the relief of not getting hurt (by using sounds like birds, water, whistles, etc.).",
"The memory I picked is my experience on the train on a solo weekend trip from Shanghai to Wuxi. I took the train at noon and the train wasn’t crowded at all. However, To my surprise, the atmosphere on the vehicle was lively, and it seemed like everyone onboard still had plenty of energy. This was unlike what I experienced on the trains I took in the late afternoon or at night when people are pretty tired and the train was peaceful since most of the passengers were sleeping or silently looking at their phones, even though the train was extremely crowded. ",
"Ever since I was a small child, I have and enjoyed travelling via train to destinations ranging from nearby cities to faraway places – mostly because of myself finding the rolling stock as my key reason for enjoyment. one recent trip to Osaka (which I went numerous times via the conventional route, involving the Nozomi train through the southern side of Honshu, through Nagoya) – involving 2 trains (the first being the Kagayaki train to Kanazawa through Nagano, the second being the Thunderbird train to Osaka), have had a lasting impact on myself. While the train trip took twice to thrice the time compared to the conventional route, the scenery switching from the city, to the mountainside, then to the seaside, and then back to the mountainside, then the lakeside and finally into the city and the experience of switching trains in a place I have never set foot before has made me realize what a train travel, back in the old days, looked like.",
